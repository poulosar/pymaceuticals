The data set provided needed to be cleaned due to some duplicate entries before we could begin analysis. There was one duplicate mouse ID found ('g989') at multiple time points. This process took the data give from 1893 total rows down to 1880 total rows. These duplicate results are enough to sway the affected Drug Regimen. Out of all the Drug Regimens used in this trial, two of them have more measurements than the others: Ramicane and Ketapril. This can be seen clearly in figure: 'Matplot Bar Figure 2.jpg'. Each treatment has 230 and 228 measurements respectively. The box and whisker plot shows ramicane and capomulin both have lower average tumor volume than Infubinol and ceftamin. The line chart: Capomulin mouse s185 tumor volume.jpg, shows mouse subject s185 and the results over the length of the trial. From the figure we can see that there was a pretty steady decline in tumor volume as time went on. In the time frame measured, there does not appear to be a leveling off in tumor volume. When we focused in on the Capomulin regimen, we found the correlation coefficient between Mouse weight and Tumor volume to be 0.842 meaning there is a strong correlation between mouse weight and Tumor volume. While this is not a perfect correlation, we have a high degree of confidence that the more a mouse weighs, the larger the tumor mass will be while using Capomulin. While Capomulin seems to be effective, there are other regimens tested that yield similar results like Ramicane.
