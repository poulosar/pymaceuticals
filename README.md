# Pymaceuticals

In this repository we explore some drug trials for an up and coming pharmaceutical company who's goal is to screen potential treatments for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). The goal is to compare the Pymaceuticals drug of interest: Capomulin to the other treatment regiments. We will retreive, clean, organize and analyze the data provided to help give some insight in to the drug trials being run. 

All data is collected and organized on the pymaceuticals_inc.ipynb file. Data is pulled from csv files located in "Resources" folder. Each figure generated in the jupyter notebook will save a .jpeg to the "Figures" folder to be viewed at a later time.

Analysis of all data is located in Pymaceutical Analysis.md
